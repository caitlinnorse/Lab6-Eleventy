<h4>How Does 11ty Work?</h4>
<p>Eleventy allows users to choose their favorite template language, as well as allowing them to choose their own directory structure and assembles all their content into a static site. If there is a desire to change the files organized in directories for the final directory, 11ty has the flexability to make that change. In order to do so, a user can specify the permalink for a particular template inside of the front matter section at the top.</p>
<br />
<h4>Front Matter</h4>
<p>The front matter created for 11ty is very easy to control and manipulate. A user can put all sorts of meta data in it, which will then be available to layouts and content.</p>
<br />
<h4>Collections</h4>
<p>Eleventy uses the tags provided in the front matter to populate collections, which can be iterated over in other templates to produce menus and lists for content.</p>
<br />
<h4>Layouts</h4>
<p>Layouts in 11ty can call and embed other layouts and access the data that is inside the front matter of the regular template files.  This can produce a better organized and modular site.</p>
<br />
<h4>11ty Configuration</h4>
<p>Eleventy prvides flexible configuration file so users can organize and configure their site the way that best fits their goals. <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/">Click here</a> for more information on how to complete this.</p>
