#### What is 11ty?

Eleventy is a Node.js static site generator. This means that the rendering work for creating a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files is done by Eleventy. The pages that are created do not need to have server-side dependencies such as runtimes or databases. Eleventy is ideally used for content sites and blogs, online shops, and reporting systems.  By using a SSG, it simplifies the creation and maintenance of a website.
