#### How Does 11ty Work?
Eleventy allows users to choose their favorite template language, as well as allowing them to choose their own directory structure and assembles all their content into a static site. If there is a desire to change the files organized in directories for the final directory, 11ty has the flexability to make that change. In order to do so, a user can specify the permalink for a particular template inside of the front matter section at the top.

<br />

#### Front Matter
The front matter created for 11ty is very easy to control and manipulate. A user can put all sorts of meta data in it, which will then be available to layouts and content. 

<br />

#### Collections
Eleventy uses the tags provided in the front matter to populate collections, which can be iterated over in other templates to produce menus and lists for content.

<br />

#### Layouts
Layouts in 11ty can call and embed other layouts and access the data that is inside the front matter of the regular template files.  This can produce a better organized and modular site.

<br />

#### 11ty Configuration
Eleventy prvides flexible configuration file so users can organize and configure their site the way that best fits their goals. [Click here](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) for more information on how to complete this.
