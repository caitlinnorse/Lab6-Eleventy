#### Pros of Using 11ty
According to [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-eleventy/),
* Eleventy does not have server-side dependencies, meaning:
    * 	hosting is simple: you’re serving HTML files
    *	systems are secure: there’s nothing to hack
    *	performance can be great.
* It is flexible, allowing users to mix and match templating engines to allow easy migration of existing content. 
* It has directory structure flexibility. This means that Eleventy will adapt to existing directory structure. It is not mandatory to save content files in a _posts directory or src folder.
* Eleventy is JavaScript. JavaScript gives users access to many modules and libraries that facilitate the development process. Eleventy is beneficial because it allows users to use Eleventy specific JavaScript.
* There is a reduced learning curve because it imports so many existing template languages.
* Easily push entire site folder to Github or Web Server.
* Entire web site can be created and tested locally on developer's computer.

#### Cons of Using 11ty
* Eleventy is relatively new, so there will be updates and changes that are necessary due to this new service.
* Commandline/tooling is required to operate.
  * Users need to have an advanced knowledge of JavaScript to use it.
* They are poor at dynamic data & query driven sites.
* Requires site to be manually updated every time there is a change.
